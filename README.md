## Usage
To use the program, open your terminal and simply type:  
<program_file_name> <source_file> <destination_file> <number_flag>

Where:
- `<program_file_name>` is the name of the compiled executable file.
- `<source_file>` is the path to the file you want to copy bytes from.
- `<destination_file>` is the name of the file that's going to be created and bytes copied to.
- `<number_flag>` is a copy order parameter:
- `0` for a normal copy order.
- `1` for reversed copy order.
Â 
## Compiling
To compile byte-copy, you can use the following command with Clang:
clang++.exe .\main.cpp -o your_file_name.exe

Replace `your_file_name.exe` with your desired executable file name.
